# Plan

Visualiser 2 will use JS Charts to visualise the data

It will visualise this in three charts for each keypress

A script will be written which will extract a few keypresses (e.g. 10 equally spread around the data set)

Each keypress will be visualised, this will allow for analysis.

Possibly use tabs for multiple keypresses on one page.
